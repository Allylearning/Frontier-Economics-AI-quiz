## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep, sophisticated blue (#387788), evoking trust and expertise.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), providing a clean, professional backdrop.
- Accent color: A deep maroon, almost burgundy, (#883847). To contrast against the light background, its saturation and brightness must be higher than the background, but lower than the primary color, so that the eye is drawn more strongly to the primary color, not the accent.
- Headline font: 'Roboto'; for body text: 'Roboto', pairing.
- Use clean, modern icons to represent different aspects of the AI policy and quiz elements.
- A clean, structured layout with clear sections for questions, answers, and feedback to ensure ease of use.
